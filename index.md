I am a Research Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}
at the University of Pennsylvania and in the 
[Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/department-biomedical-and-health-informatics-dbhi){:target="_blank"}
at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
I am a member of the [PRECISE Center](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
and the [Center for Devices, Health, and Technology](https://healthtech.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of 
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the internet-of-medical-things (IoMT) and
autonomous vehicles (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address 
challenges arising from "thin data", which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, 
anomalies, and sensing constraints. Find out more here. 

I am a Co-Founder of 
[Neuralert Technologies](https://neuralerttechnologies.com/){:target="_blank"} 
and Vasowatch.
