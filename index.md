I am a Research Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/)
at the University of Pennsylvania and in the 
[Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/department-biomedical-and-health-informatics-dbhi)
at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
I am a member of the [PRECISE Center](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/) 
and the [Center for Devices, Health, and Technology](https://healthtech.upenn.edu/).

My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of 
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the **internet-of-medical-things** (IoMT) and
**autonomous vehicles** (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address 
challenges arising from _"thin data"_, which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, 
anomalies, and sensing constraints. Find out more [here](/research). 

I am a Co-Founder of 
[Neuralert Technologies](https://neuralerttechnologies.com/)
and Vasowatch.
