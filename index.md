I am an Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/)
at Vanderbilt University. 
I am a member of the [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/), 
and the [Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/).

[//]: # (Technical Advisor for the [Center for Devices, Health, and Technology](https://healthtech.upenn.edu/),  on the Executive Committee for the [Community Collaboratory for Co-Creation (Penn4c)](https://www.penn4c.org/),  the SEAS Faculty Advisor for [Penn Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.sas.upenn.edu/), and the Director of the [Medical Device Club](https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/meddevclub/).)

My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of 
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the **internet-of-medical-things** (IoMT) and
**autonomous vehicles** (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address 
challenges arising from _"thin data"_, which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, 
anomalies, and sensing constraints. Find out more [here](/research){: target="_self"}. 

I am a Co-Founder of 
[Neuralert Technologies](https://www.neuralerttechnologies.com/)
and [Vasowatch](https://vasowatch.com/).
