I am a Research Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/)
at the University of Pennsylvania and in the 
[Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/department-biomedical-and-health-informatics-dbhi)
at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. 
I am a member of the [PRECISE Center](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/), 
the Technical Advisor for the [Center for Devices, Health, and Technology](https://healthtech.upenn.edu/),
on the Executive Committee for the [Community Collaboratory for Co-Creation (Penn4c)](https://www.penn4c.org/),
the SEAS Faculty Advisor for [Penn Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.sas.upenn.edu/), 
and the Director of the [Medical Device Club](https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/meddevclub/).

My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of 
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the **internet-of-medical-things** (IoMT) and
**autonomous vehicles** (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address 
challenges arising from _"thin data"_, which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, 
anomalies, and sensing constraints. Find out more [here](/research){: target="_self"}. 

I am a Co-Founder of 
[Neuralert Technologies](https://www.neuralerttechnologies.com/)
and [Vasowatch](https://vasowatch.com/).
