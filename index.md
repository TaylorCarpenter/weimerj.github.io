## <span style="color:red">I am hiring PhD students -- if interested, please mention my name in your application</span>.

I am an Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/)
at Vanderbilt University. 
I am a member of the [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/), 
and the [Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/). 
I am the Director of the [Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Lab]() and the [Medical Device Club]().

My research develops foundations and tools for safety guarantees and predictable performance of 
learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS) - primarily targeting the **internet-of-medical-things** (IoMT) and
**autonomous vehicles** (AVs). Specifically, my research aims to develop tools and techniques to address 
challenges arising from _"data constraints"_, which can be caused by unmodeled variability, dataset shifts, 
anomalies, and sensing limitations. Find out more [here](/research){: target="_self"}. 

I am a Co-Founder of 
[Neuralert Technologies](https://www.neuralerttechnologies.com/)
and [Vasowatch](https://vasowatch.com/).
