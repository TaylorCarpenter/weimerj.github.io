There is a growing recognition of the importance of robustness in machine learning stemming from the discovery 
and prevalence of adversarial examples. Consequently, monitoring and analysis of adversarial examples in machine 
learning has received much interest recently. While much of the work is focused on small perturbations to input 
images, even children would not be fooled by these adversarial examples due to the robustness of their concepts.  
Thus, this proposal aims to re-think robust and adaptive machine learning to unlock the key to generative and 
flexible learning by understanding how very young children approach the world.  Our goal is to advent truly 
robust and adaptive learning tools that benefit---as children do---from experiences and interactions in the world.
